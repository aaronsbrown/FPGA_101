# Project TODOs & MIDI Debug Plan

## 1. SystemVerilog Conversion (Future Task)

* **Goal:** Improve code readability, maintainability, and leverage modern HDL features.
* **Benefits:** More concise syntax (`always_ff`, `always_comb`), stronger type checking (`logic`), enumerated types for states (`enum`), potentially interfaces/structs later.
* **Plan:**
  * Identify modules for conversion (e.g., start with `midi_uart_tx`, `midi_note_sender`, `seq_player`).
  * Incrementally convert modules, ensuring simulation tests pass after each significant change.
  * Replace `reg`/`wire` with `logic`.
  * Convert state machines to use `enum` types.
  * Use `always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge rst)` for sequential blocks.
  * Use `always_comb` for purely combinational logic.
  * Verify toolchain support (Yosys generally supports SV well, but check specific features).

## 2. MIDI Bug Debug Journal & Next Steps

* **Problem:** Hardware transmission consistently fails to send Velocity and (in most multi-byte tests) Status bytes, resulting in logs showing only Note bytes (`0x3c`, `0x3e`, etc.) despite Verilog logic appearing correct.
* **Diagnosis:**
  * Basic UART transmission (`midi_uart_tx`) seems functional (proven by 1-byte Status test).
  * `midi_note_sender` state machine successfully sends the *first* byte when isolated.
  * Failure occurs during the transition/waiting period *between* sending bytes in the multi-byte sequence.
  * Logs show no relevant synthesis warnings pointing to obvious optimizations/errors.
  * Tests indicate a potential issue with how `uart_is_busy` is behaving or being interpreted *after* the first byte transmission completes, *or* a subtle timing glitch allows `seq_player` to re-trigger `midi_note_sender` prematurely.
* **Strategy Decision:** The various test modifications (1-byte, 2-byte, delay states) were useful diagnostic steps but didn't fix the root cause in the intended 3-byte sender. We should revert to the most logically complete version and debug that directly.
* **Action - Revert Code:**
  * Revert `midi_note_sender.v` to the version designed to send all 3 bytes, including the `WAIT_LAST_BYTE` state and the combined busy logic `assign busy = (state != IDLE) || uart_is_busy;`. (This was the code from the response just before the final failing 2-byte test). *Self-correction: Use the version with the WAIT_LAST_BYTE state as that logic is sounder for preventing the busy glitch.*

    ```verilog
    // Key elements of the target version to revert to:
    module midi_note_sender ( ... );
        localparam IDLE=3'd0, SEND_STATUS=3'd1, SEND_NOTE=3'd2, SEND_VELOCITY=3'd3, WAIT_LAST_BYTE=3'd4;
        reg [2:0] state;
        wire uart_is_busy;
        // ... latching regs ...
        midi_uart_tx uart ( .busy(uart_is_busy), ... );
        assign busy = (state != IDLE); // Use simple busy logic with WAIT_LAST_BYTE state

        always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
            // ...
            case(state)
                IDLE: if(trigger) state <= SEND_STATUS; // Latch inputs here
                SEND_STATUS:   if(!uart_is_busy) { /*prep*/ uart_send_d <= 1; state <= SEND_NOTE; }
                SEND_NOTE:     if(!uart_is_busy) { /*prep*/ uart_send_d <= 1; state <= SEND_VELOCITY; }
                SEND_VELOCITY: if(!uart_is_busy) { /*prep*/ uart_send_d <= 1; state <= WAIT_LAST_BYTE; } // Go to WAIT
                WAIT_LAST_BYTE: if(!uart_is_busy) { state <= IDLE; } // Wait here
                default: state <= IDLE;
            endcase
            // ...
        end
    endmodule
    ```

* **Action - Implement LED Debugging:**
    1. **Modify Verilog:** Route key internal signals up through `sequencer.v` and `top.v` to unused FPGA output pins connected to LEDs.
        * `midi_note_sender` internal `state` (needs 3 LEDs).
        * `uart_is_busy` (wire from UART output, 1 LED).
        * `uart_send` (signal to UART input, 1 LED - will be fast flashes).
        * `trigger` (input to `midi_note_sender`, 1 LED).
        * `busy` (output from `midi_note_sender`, 1 LED).
    2. **Slow Down UART:** Inside `midi_note_sender.v`, override the `BAUD_RATE` parameter when instantiating `midi_uart_tx` to an extremely low value (e.g., `10` or `1`).

        ```verilog
        // Example:
        midi_uart_tx #(
            .BAUD_RATE(10) // DEBUG ONLY
        ) uart ( ... );
        ```

    3. **Synthesize & Flash:** Rebuild the project with the LED connections and the slow baud rate.
    4. **Observe:** Watch the LEDs carefully when a note should be triggered (e.g., when the `trigger` LED flashes).
        * Does the `state` sequence match expectations (`IDLE`->`STATUS`->`NOTE`->`VELOCITY`->`WAIT`->`IDLE`)?
        * How does the `uart_is_busy` LED behave relative to the `uart_send` flash and the `state` changes? Does it stay high for the expected long duration (~1 sec per byte at 10 baud)? Does it correctly go low?
        * Does the overall `busy` LED stay high during the entire multi-second sequence?
        * Identify exactly *where* the observed sequence deviates from the expected logic.
* **Contingency:** If LED debugging doesn't reveal the issue (e.g., it's too fast even when slowed, or behaviour is still unclear), the next step is to investigate Soft Logic Analyzers.
* **Remember:** Revert the `BAUD_RATE` change after debugging!

## 3. Open Source Soft Logic Analyzers (Info)

* **What:** HDL cores (Verilog/VHDL) you add to your FPGA design to capture internal signals, similar to vendor ILAs (SignalTap/ChipScope). Necessary for deep hardware debugging with open-source toolchains.
* **How:**
  * **Instantiate Core:** Add the analyzer core module to your design.
  * **Connect Signals:** Wire the internal signals you want to probe to the core's inputs.
  * **Configure Trigger:** Set up conditions within the core to start capturing data (e.g., edge, signal value, state match).
  * **Capture:** Core samples signals on `clk` edges and stores them in FPGA Block RAM (BRAM).
  * **Readback:** Core sends captured data out of FPGA (commonly via UART, sometimes Wishbone/AXI, GPIO) to a host PC.
  * **Host Software:** A PC-side script/application reads the data, parses it, and often saves it as a VCD file or similar.
  * **View:** Use tools like GTKWave or PulseView (for Sigrok format) to visualize the captured waveforms.
* **Finding Cores:** Search GitHub, OpenCores.org, etc. for "FPGA soft logic analyzer verilog", "open source embedded logic analyzer", "sigrok fpga ila". Look for cores with UART readback for simplicity if you have a spare UART interface.
* **Effort:** Requires manual HDL integration, BRAM resource usage, setting up the readback mechanism (UART connection, host script), potentially adapting existing cores. More involved than vendor tools.
* **When to Use:** If LED debugging fails to pinpoint the MIDI bug.
