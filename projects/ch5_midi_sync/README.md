# Chapter 5: MIDI Synchronization

This chapter focuses on **syncing FPGA-generated music** with external digital audio workstations (DAWs) and MIDI controllers.

## Topics Covered
- **MIDI Clock Reading:** Synchronizing FPGA timing with external MIDI signals
- **MIDI-Triggered Events:** Generating events in response to MIDI input

## Projects in This Chapter
- [`midi_clock_reader/`](midi_clock_reader/) - Parsing MIDI clock signals for tempo sync
- [`fpga_daw_sync/`](fpga_daw_sync/) - Keeping FPGA rhythms locked to a DAW's BPM

## Next Steps
Proceed to **Chapter 6: Final Project**, where everything comes together in a full-scale generative synth system.
