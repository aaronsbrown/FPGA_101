# Chapter 3: Interfacing

This chapter covers **how FPGAs communicate with external devices**, enabling interaction with sensors, displays, and other digital systems.

## Topics Covered
- **Bus Communication:** Reading an 8-bit bus for external input
- **DAC Interface:** Generating analog control voltages
- **MIDI Interface:** Handling MIDI signals for music applications

## Projects in This Chapter
- [`bus_edge_detection/`](bus_edge_detection/) - Detecting changes on an external bus
- [`dac_interface/`](dac_interface/) - Sending digital data to a DAC for analog output
- [`midi_interface/`](midi_interface/) - Processing MIDI signals for musical applications

## Next Steps
Proceed to **Chapter 4: Generative Music** to implement music sequencing and rhythm generation on FPGA.
