# Chapter 2: Clocking & Timing Control

This chapter introduces **clock management** and **timing control**, essential for FPGA design.

## Topics Covered
- **Clock Dividers:** Generating slower clocks from the main FPGA clock
- **Counters:** Implementing 4-bit, 8-bit, and variable-length counters
- **Timing Signals:** Synchronizing outputs based on clock cycles

## Projects in This Chapter
- [`clock_divider/`](clock_divider/) - Creating precise time intervals using clock division
- [`bpm_pulse_generator_static/`](bpm_pulse_generator_static/) - Generating pulses based on a BPM setting
- [`counter_4bit/`](counter_4bit/) - Using counters to increment values

## Next Steps
Proceed to **Chapter 3: Interfacing** to connect FPGA with external hardware.
