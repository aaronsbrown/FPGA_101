# Chapter 1: Basics

This chapter covers **fundamental digital logic** concepts to establish a strong FPGA foundation.

## Topics Covered
- **Combinational Logic:** AND, OR, XOR gates, multiplexers
- **Sequential Logic:** Flip-flops, counters, state machines
- **Simple LED Control:** Blinking an LED, sequential LED patterns

## Projects in This Chapter
- [`combinational_logic/`](combinational_logic/) - Basic logic gates
- [`flip_flops/`](flip_flops/) - D, T, and JK flip-flops
- [`sequential_logic/`](sequential_logic/) - Simple counters & FSMs
- [`led_blink/`](led_blink/) - A minimal "Hello FPGA" project
- [`led_sequential/`](led_sequential/) - Sequential LED control using flip-flops

## Next Steps
After mastering these concepts, proceed to **Chapter 2: Clocking & Timing Control** to learn about FPGA clock division and precise timing.
