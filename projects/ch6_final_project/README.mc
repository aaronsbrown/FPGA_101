# Chapter 6: Final Project - Hybrid FPGA Synth System

This chapter brings together everything learned so far, combining **rhythm, melody, and sync elements** into a complete generative synth system.

## Topics Covered
- **Hybrid FPGA-Teensy Synth:** Using both an FPGA and a Teensy microcontroller for generative music
- **Eurorack Integration:** Designing an FPGA-based Eurorack module
- **Performance & Optimization:** Improving timing, reducing power consumption

## Projects in This Chapter
- [`hybrid_fpga_teensy_synth/`](hybrid_fpga_teensy_synth/) - FPGA and Teensy working together for music generation
- [`eurorack_integration/`](eurorack_integration/) - Adapting FPGA-based control voltages to Eurorack modular synths

## Conclusion
At this stage, you will have developed a **fully functional generative music system**, learning advanced FPGA concepts along the way.
