# FPGA 101 - Learning and Experimentation

Welcome to the **FPGA 101** repository! This project is structured to facilitate learning and hands-on experimentation with FPGAs, progressing from fundamental concepts to real-world applications.

## Weekly Learning Curriculum

This repository is organized based on a structured weekly curriculum, designed to help you progressively build FPGA expertise. Each week focuses on specific topics, with practical projects and exercises.

### Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Topics Covered |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Introduction to FPGA, Verilog Basics, Toolchain Setup |
| 2    | Combinational Logic, Simulation, and Synthesis |
| 3    | Sequential Logic, Flip-Flops, and Registers |
| 4    | State Machines, Counters, and Timing Constraints |
| 5    | FPGA-Specific Optimizations and Resource Constraints |
| 6    | Interfacing with External Components (LEDs, Buttons) |
| 7    | Clock Management, PLLs, and Clock Division |
| 8    | Creating a Simple CPU or FSM-Based Controller |
| 9    | Real-Time Signal Processing and Custom Peripherals |
| 10   | Advanced Topics (AXI, PCIe, Embedded Processors) |

Each week's folder contains project files, notes, and exercises tailored to reinforce the learning objectives.
